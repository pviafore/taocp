1)  In the binary tree (2), what is INFO(LLINK(RLINK(RLINK(T))))

   H

2)  List the nodes of a binary tree in pre-order, in-order, post-order

    1,2,4,5,3,6,7

    4,2,5,1,6,3,7

    4,5,2,6,7,3,1

3)  Are the terminal nodes of a binary tree always in the same order regardless of traversal strategy?

    Yes, becasue you always check nodes in the same order, left-tree then right tree. Whether we print them out or not doesn't matter at the terminal nodes, because there are no left or right subtrees.

    So you always will hit the left most node before hitting any other terminal node.

4)  What about a right-first pre-order?

    1,3,7,6,2,5,4  , which is the reverse of a post-order traversal

5)  When using a binary representation of trees(0 for left, 1 for right), what is pre, in , and post order traversal described as.

    1, 10, 100, 101, 11, 110, 111  (pre-order is a lexicographic sort of nodes)

    100, 10, 101, 1, 110, 11, 111 (in-order is a lexicographic sort if "empty" is > 0 but < 1)

    100, 101, 10, 110, 111, 11, 1 (post-order lexicographic sort if "empty" > 1)

6)  Show that a permutation of indices generated can be generated by putting 1,2,...,N into a stack and popped strategically

    So for in-order, you push the numbers onto the stack until you've pushed a terminal node. If you hit a terminal node, immediately pop that node, and the node following as long as the stack is non empty

    If pre-order is 
    
    1,2,4,5,3,6,7

    ```
    push 1
    push 2
    push 3
    pop  3
    pop  2
    push 4
    pop  4
    pop  1
    push 5
    push 6
    pop  6
    pop  5
    push 7 
    pop  7
    ```

    Which means you pop the indices as 3,2,4,1,6,5,7, which gives a in-order as 4,2,5,1,6,3,7.

    This works because if you are a left node, then you pop yourself, and then pop your parent, who was the next node up (and the "visit" after visiting you the left).

    If you are a right node, then you pop yourself (you have nowhere to travel to the right), and by popping the next node, you are popping your ancestor who traversed left first.

7)  Show that if we are given the pre-order and post-order traversal, we can construct the structure

    We can't do pre-order alone, as it doesn't distinguish between

    (1, (2, (3))) (all left links)

    and

    (1, (2, 3)) (triangle structure)

    In-order doesn't distinguish between

    (1, (2, (3)))

    and 

    (2, (3 1))

    So it can't be one alone.

    A pre-order will confuse a list of left only links and the triangle structure, but we can cross reference the in-order traversal at the same time (it is convenient that we can binary search through in-order traversal to find out what node we should be on) and see if it matches up.

    Post-order and in-order should be able to rectify things as well for the same reason.

    However, pre-order and post-order will not give an answer, as a simple (A, (B)) link will confuse them. For both, the answer is AB and BA, but there is no way to tell if B is the left link or the right link in this case (the in-order will bisect to tell us which link a side is on.)
