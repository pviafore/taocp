# MIX

This is a computer simulating a MIX computer as described in Donald Knuth's book : The Art of Computer Programming.

Work in ongoing in adding arithmetic instructions.

To use this computer (it's not a library), you'll have to modify the main method to construct a computer, and then
run `run_command` on the computer (see unit tests in computer.rs for examples).
